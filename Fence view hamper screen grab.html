        <p class="lead text-muted">
            In today’s digital age, protecting sensitive documents is more important than ever. MaiPDF offers a unique feature known as **Fence View**, which enhances the security of your PDFs by preventing screen capturing, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot extract or distribute your content.
        </p>

        <h4>How Fence View Works</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
            Fence View is designed to prevent screen capture activities, which are a common vulnerability for unauthorized users trying to copy or distribute sensitive content. By disabling screenshot and screen recording tools, it ensures that your documents remain secure and confidential.

Therefore, the effectiveness of this feature depends on individual preferences and needs, striking a balance between security and user experience.

        <p class="lead">
            MaiPDF offers two distinct features for sharing and managing PDF files: the Cloud Share and Offline Version. This article compares these two features, highlighting their differences and helping you decide which one is best suited for your needs.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Cloud Share</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
            MaiPDF's Cloud Share allows you to securely store PDF files on its cloud platform and share them via a link. Unlike the Offline Version, Cloud Share doesn't have an expiration date but offers access control based on the number of times the file is accessed. Once the access limit is reached, the link becomes inactive.

        </div>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Offline Version</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
            The Offline Version allows you to share PDF files embedded within an HTML file. This feature enables offline access, but with the added ability to set an expiration date and time restrictions for file viewing. It's ideal for temporary access scenarios, where you need precise control over access duration.

        <h4 class="mt-5">Which One to Choose?</h4>
        <p>
            Both the Cloud Share and Offline Version offer distinct advantages depending on your needs. If you require access control based on a set number of views without specifying an exact expiration date, the Cloud Share is your ideal choice. However, if you prefer to set specific time limits or expiration dates for access, the Offline Version is a better fit.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            MaiPDF provides flexible solutions for PDF sharing, whether through Cloud Share for access limit control or Offline Version for time-limited access. By understanding the features of both options, you can choose the one that aligns with your document sharing and security needs.

        <p><strong>Zero-width characters</strong> are special types of characters that occupy space in text but do not display any visible symbol. They are often used in encryption and steganography to hide information or mark parts of text without affecting the appearance of the text itself.</p>

        <h3>Types of Zero-Width Characters:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Zero-Width Space (ZWSP):</strong> The most common zero-width character, often used for hiding information in text. It can be inserted without altering the readability of the text.</li>
          <li><strong>Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ):</strong> Used to prevent the joining of characters, common in languages like Arabic and Persian.</li>
          <li><strong>Zero-Width Joiner (ZWJ):</strong> Forces characters to join, used in certain writing systems to combine letters.</li>
          <li><strong>Zero-Width Non-Breaking Space (ZWNBSP):</strong> Prevents line breaks at a specific point in the text.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications of Zero-Width Characters:</h3>
        <p>Because of their invisibility, zero-width characters are important in various applications, especially in encryption and steganography:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Steganography:</strong> Zero-width characters are commonly used in steganography to hide messages within regular text, making the information invisible to the naked eye but retrievable through specialized tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Zero-width characters can be used to encrypt data, embedding encrypted content within regular text, ensuring that only those with the decryption key can extract the information.</li>
          <li><strong>Tracking Prevention:</strong> Zero-width characters are used to hide metadata or tracking information, especially in online forms or content to prevent surveillance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Zero-Width Characters and Privacy Protection:</h3>
        <p>In todayâ€™s digital age, privacy and security are critical concerns. Zero-width characters offer an effective and hidden method to protect sensitive information. By embedding data in plain text, zero-width characters allow for secure communication without revealing the information to unauthorized users.</p>

            This article introduces MaiPDF, a tool that converts PDF documents into shareable links and QR codes. Generating links to PDF files is incredibly useful.  It allows content to be displayed anytime, anywhere, eliminating the hassle of traditional PDF file sharing. Sending PDFs as email attachments can be cumbersome for both sender and recipient. Sharing via instant messaging often limits effective information dissemination.  Uploading PDFs directly to social media platforms like Facebook isn't always the most efficient approach.  When PDFs are instruction manuals or other important documents, relying on email or IM can be particularly inconvenient.

            </div>
            Therefore, a tool capable of quickly converting PDFs into links and displaying the PDF content instantly upon opening is essential. MaiPDF is free to use, offering both guest access and registration options.  There are no restrictions on usage or the number of views.  MaiPDF's advantages over other QR code tools include:
            <ul>
              <li>Direct opening via link, displaying the PDF natively (no extra functions).</li>
              <li>No intrusive applet jumps (users are tired of these).</li>
              <li>Option to set a limited number of views for PDFs (self-destructing after reading).</li>
              <li>Various security settings, such as disabling downloads and printing, and setting reading time limits.</li>
              <li>Reading reminders (email reminders - free).</li>
              <li>Ability to modify file content even after the link has been shared.</li>
              <li>Comprehensive document control panel (free for registered users) and quick settings (for guest users).</li>
            </ul>

            It can be used for intellectual property protection, ensuring the security of academic and research information. You can set up a downloadable version for easy distribution or create a secure link to prevent unauthorized sharing.  Even after a PDF link is shared, the author retains remote control, with the ability to change the content or invalidate the link at any time.

            This tool isn't restricted like paid alternatives.  However, when setting view limits and reading times, avoid leaving these blank, as this will randomly assign 10 views. For unlimited views, set the view count to a high number (e.g., 999999).  The read count can be set up to 10,000 times, and you can query the file's view records, showing when and on which device (phone or computer) the file was opened.

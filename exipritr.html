    <h1>Expiring a File: Set a Limit on PDF Views with MaiPDF</h1>
    <p class="header-text">With MaiPDF, you can set a limit on how many times your PDF file can be viewed and even modify the link after it's been shared.</p>
  </header>

  <!-- Main Content -->
  <div class="container">
    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">What is Expiring a File?</h2>
      <p>MaiPDF's <strong>Expiring a File</strong> feature allows you to set a limited number of views for your PDF file. Once the specified number of views is reached, the link to the PDF will no longer work. This gives you greater control over how your document is accessed, especially when sharing sensitive or time-limited information.</p>
      <p>Not only can you control the number of views, but MaiPDF also provides flexibility to modify or revoke the link after you've shared it, ensuring you remain in control of your document even after it’s been sent out.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">How Does Expiring a File Work?</h2>
      <p>When you generate a link for your PDF using MaiPDF, you can set the number of times the document can be opened. Here’s how the feature works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set a View Limit:</strong> You can define how many times your PDF can be opened before the link expires. For example, if you set a limit of 10 views, the link will stop working after 10 people have opened the document.</li>
        <li><strong>Modify the Link:</strong> After sending the PDF link, you can still modify or disable it at any time. This gives you the ability to prevent further access if necessary, even if the link has already been shared with others.</li>
        <li><strong>Receive Notifications:</strong> You can also receive notifications or track when the document is accessed, so you are always aware of the document's usage.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Why Should You Use Expiring a File?</h2>
      <p>The Expiring a File feature is ideal for those who need to control the distribution of their PDF documents. Here’s why you should consider using it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Limit Access:</strong> Prevent the document from being accessed indefinitely, especially when dealing with sensitive or time-limited information.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Distribution:</strong> If you want to ensure that only a specific number of people view your document, you can set a limit and stop unauthorized access after the limit is reached.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain Flexibility:</strong> Even after sharing the link, you have the flexibility to modify or revoke the link if you change your mind or need to stop further access.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Who Can Benefit from Expiring a File?</h2>
      <p>Expiring a File is especially useful for users who need to control access to their documents in a secure and efficient way. Here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Businesses:</strong> Ensure that confidential documents, contracts, and proposals are not accessible after a certain period or after they've been viewed by a limited number of people.</li>
        <li><strong>Freelancers:</strong> Keep track of project proposals or legal documents that are only relevant for a short time or until they've been reviewed a certain number of times.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Professionals:</strong> Secure access to sensitive legal documents and ensure that they are not distributed indefinitely without permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Institutions:</strong> Set a limit on the number of views for exam papers or research documents to control access and prevent unauthorized distribution.</li>
      </ul>
